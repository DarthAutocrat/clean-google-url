# clean-google-url
a simple JS Bookmarklet to remove cruft from Googler SERP URLs


Based on a Tweet from @lilyraynyc (https://twitter.com/lilyraynyc/status/1677643886657785858).

How to use this:
In your browser, add a new Bookmark.
Highlight & Copy the little JS string in to the URL field, give it a sensible name
(such as Clean Google URL),
then hit "save".

Now, any SERP you're on, you can click the bookmarklet, and get a cleaned URL (only the important bits are left :D)
